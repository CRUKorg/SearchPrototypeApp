# We're done doing a search prototype app

What is this? It's a proof of concept for using Angular to access ElasticSearch.

## Installing it

Check out the codebase then run:

```
npm install
```

This will drag down all of the dependencies for you, easy.

## Running the app

```

```

This will spin up a server for you, and watch for any changes to existing JavaScript or SCSS files.

## Running tests

```
npm test
```
